  # `$HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA` in PHP.

  # 200. Any other code will be handled via on_upload_fail callback. Your
  # application is free to inspect the status code and response text in that

  #
  # You cannot have multiple uploads for one snapshot running at the same time,
  # but you are free to start another upload after one succeeds or fails.

  # object or calling {JpegCamera#capture}.
  #
  # @option options api_url [String] URL where the snapshots will be uploaded.
  # @option options csrf_token [String] CSRF token to be sent in the
  #   __X-CSRF-Token__ header during upload.
  # @option options timeout [Integer] __IGNORED__ (__NOT__ __IMPLEMENTED__)
  #   The number of milliseconds a request can take before automatically being
  #   terminated. Default of 0 means there is no timeout.
  # @option options on_upload_done [Function] Function to call when upload
  #   completes. Snapshot object will be available as `this`, response body will
  #   be passed as the first argument. Calling {Snapshot#done done} before the
  #   upload exits will change the handler for this upload.
  # @option options on_upload_fail [Function] Function to call when upload
  #   fails. Snapshot object will be available as `this`, response code will
  #   be passed as the first argument followed by error message and response
  #   body. Calling {Snapshot#fail fail} before the upload exits will change
  #   the handler for this upload.
  # @option options retry_if [Function] Function to be called before any upload
  #   done/fail callbacks to decide if the upload should be retried. By default
  #   it's null and uploads are never retried.
  #   Inside the function snapshot object will be available as `this` and the
  #   arguments will be: `status_code`, `error_message`, `response`, `retry`.
  #   `retry` is a number incremented for each retry and starting with 1 when
  #   the upload finishes for the first time.
  #   If the function returns `true` or `0` then upload will be retried
  #   immediately. Number greater than `0` will delay the retry by
  #   that many milliseconds. Any other value will be treated as a decision not
  #   to retry the upload and one of the `on_upload_done` or `on_upload_fail`
  #   callbacks will be fired instead.
  # @option options retry_success [Boolean] By default `retry_if` is not called
  #   for uploads that finish with a status code from the 2XX range. Set this
  #   to `true` if you want to retry some of these responses. This can be
  #   useful if you're experiencing some network oddities.
